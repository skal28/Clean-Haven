Clean Haven README
Project Overview
Welcome to Clean Haven, a web-based game designed to promote environmental awareness and contribute to real-world tree plantation efforts. Players engage in planting and nurturing virtual trees, participating in clean-up events, and ultimately minting mature trees as NFTs. Clean Haven combines environmental education with interactive gameplay to inspire players to make a positive impact on the planet.
